            <p>
              Jufa Inc. (hereafter "Jufa"), respects your privacy and understands that you find it important 
              that your privacy is not violated.  We therefore do everything in our power to treat and process
              the data you provide us with confidentially.  Our starting point is to treat and process as little
              of your data as possible; all in the interest of your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The provisions of this privacy statement apply to what takes place on our website, if you contact us

              While we will register your email address, name and possibly telephone number, these will only be used for the purpose
              for which you contact us.  This is to say, we must be able to reach you in order to answer your question.  If we have
              answered your question, we will either delete the data or store it in the file if the contact moment leads to cooperation.

              necessary for the execution of the contract for services.
            </p>
            <p>
              If no cooperation is established, we will delete your data as soon as we discover that no cooperation results from the contact
              moment that you have had with us.
            </p>
            <p>

          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Legal bases for data processing</h2>
            <p>
              The personal data of clients are processed on the basis of the "execution of a contract", namely: the contract of services concluded
              between the client and Jufa.  If no contract of services has yet been concluded between the parties, but its conclusion is expected,
              the personal data of the (future) client will be processed on the basis of a "legitimate interest".
            </p>
            <p>
              Data of (potential) future clients that complete the contact form on the website is processed on the basis of a "legitimate interest";
              afterall, the personal data of these prospects are processed in order to (possibly) conclude an agreement between the parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, personal data relating to invoices, among other things, are processed on the basis of a "statutory obligation".
            </p>

          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Purpose of data processing</h2>
            <p>
              Jufa processes your personal data in the context of the execution of a contract of services concluded with you, which also includes
              contacting you by telephone or in writting (by email or post) in connection with this agreement. In the event that no agreement has yet
              been concluded, Jufa will process your personal data in order to enable the conclusion of such an agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal data relating to invoicing are processed in order to facilitate invoicing and to comply with the statutory obligation regarding
              the retention period.
            </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Retention period</h2>
            <p>
              Jufa will store your personal data no longer than strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which your data is collected.  This means
              that your personal data will be deleted immediately as soon as the client relationship with you comes to end.
            </p>
            <p>
              The personal data that are stored on the basis of a statutory obligation, such as the financial documents and invoices, are stored for the 
              statutory retention period of 7 years.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Sharing with third parties</h2>
              <p>
                Jufa only provides your personal data to third parties if this is necessary for the execution of the agreement with you, or in order to 
                comply with a statutory obligation. 
              </p>
            
            <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Protection</h2>
