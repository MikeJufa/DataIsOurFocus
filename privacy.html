          <p>
            Jufa Inc. (hereafter "Jufa"), respects your privacy and understands that you find it important 
            that your privacy is not violated.  We therefore do everything in our power to treat and process
            the data you provide us with confidentially.  Our starting point is to treat and process as little
            of your data as possible; all in the interest of your privacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The provisions of this privacy statement apply to what takes place on our website, if you contact us
            via the website using the contact form or email, and/or if you, as a client, enter into a relationship with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We advise you to read this statement carefully so that you know exactly what we are doing to protect your privacy.
            Should you still have any questions after reading this privacy statement, we would be pleased to hear from you
            via contact form or email.  You can choose to call us at 416-303-7888.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Reference</h2>
          <p>
            If you have concluded a contract for services with us, it will refer you to this privacy statement on our website.
            Also, this privacy statement can be viewed on our website at any time.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Contact moments</h2>
          <p>
            If you contact us by email and/or via contact form on our websites, we will treat this information confidentially.
            While we will register your email address, name and possibly telephone number, these will only be used for the purpose
            for which you contact us.  This is to say, we must be able to reach you in order to answer your question.  If we have
            answered your question, we will either delete the data or store it in the file if the contact moment leads to cooperation.
            In the event of cooperation, we will conclude an order confirmation/agreement with you, in which we again include provisions
            on how we handle your privacy data.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will not use the data you provide to make unsolicited contact with you, nor will we send you an unsolicited newsletter
            or information about our company.
          </p>

          <p>
            If cooperation is established between you and our company, we will only store you data to the extent and for the duration
            necessary for the execution of the contract for services.
          </p>

          <p>
            If no cooperation is established, we will delete your data as soon as we discover that no cooperation results from the contact
            moment that you have had with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you become a client of our company, we will retain your data until the client relationship with you ends.  We will also delete
            your data at your request, with due observance of the statutory retention periods.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Data processed</h2>
          <p>
            Jufa may process your personal data because you have provided it by completing the contact form on our website or because you used
            the services of our company. By using our services, you consent to the processing of personal data by Jufa.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jufa may process the following personal data:
            <li>First name and surname</li>
            <li>Address particulars</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Bank details</li>
            <li>Government issued personal identity number</li>
            <li>Credit card information</li>
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="text-body-emphasis">Legal bases for data processing</h2>
          <p>
            The personal data of clients are processed on the basis of the "execution of a contract", namely: the contract of services concluded
            between the client and Jufa.  If no contract of services has yet been concluded between the parties, but its conclusion is expected,
            the personal data of the (future) client will be processed on the basis of a "legitimate interest".
